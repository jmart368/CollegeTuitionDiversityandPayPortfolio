Purpose
------------------------
The cost of pursuing a higher education in the United States is a contested topic of discussion. In a survey conducted by the University of California - Los Angeles, around 85% of newly enrolled freshman believed that enrolling in college would lead to obtaining a better job opportunity and about 72% cited that pursuing a higher education would lead to of making more money (Kerr 2019). Whether we agree or disagree with these freshmen that pursuing a higher education is worth the cost, one thing that isn't disputed is the rising cost of attending these schools. Furthermore, to exacerbate the rising cost, there is also a diversity gap dilemma for minority students whom pursue a lesser quality of education which leads to a gap in career pay. In an analysis conducted by the Center of American Progress, federal data showed that “Black and Hispanic graduates also generally have attended institutions that have less money to spend on offering a quality education. And they are significantly underrepresented in important fields such as engineering and education, mathematics and statistics, and the physical sciences” (Libassi 2018). This leads us to further question and analyze college cost as whole. 

The purpose of this project is to examine several data sets from different colleges and universities that involve tuition, diversity, and pay. This project aims to highlight a social and economic issue that plays a role in the educational disparity in the United States.

Datasets
------------------------
We are given the following datasets to explore.

* **tuition_income.csv** -  Income made from Tuition and fees which denotes the income bracket level for a given school throughout a given a year.
* **tuition_cost.csv** - Tuition and fees by college/university for 2018-2019, along with school type, degree length, state, in-state vs out-of-state.
* **salary_potential.csv** - Salary potential data from each school.
* **diversity_school.csv** - Diversity by college/university along with school type, degree length, state, in-state vs out-of-state.
